      <p>It is a journey of learning the course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition">The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)</a>.</p>
      <p>The course is based on react 16.0, but today the react is 18.2 right now. A lot of things have been changed, so often I have to investigate the new implementation for each point of the course.</p>
      <p>Below are the differences to the course:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using React 18.2, so Redux, Router, etc are changed</li>
        <li>Using React Testing Library, because Enzyme is deprecated in React 18</li>
        <li>Using Webpack 5, so change to use mini-css-extract-plugin and html-webpack-plugin</li>
        <li>Using Azure, because Heroku is not free right now</li>
        <li>DoNot using express, because Github provides pipeline to deploy to Azure</li>
      </ul>
